# IPL Data Analysis using Apache Spark

This project focuses on data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of IPL cricket data using PySpark. The analysis covers data cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering, statistical summaries, and visualization of key trends and patterns.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains ball-by-ball and match-level information from past IPL seasons.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- Missing value analysis and handling
- Feature engineering (e.g., total runs, average scores)
- Summary statistics
- Trend identification (team performance, player analysis)
- Data transformations using Spark DataFrame APIs
- Initial visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Visual Insights

The notebook includes:
- Team win distributions
- Toss decision patterns
- Most consistent players and top-performing teams
- Seasonal trends and anomalies

## 📂 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ipl-data-analysis-spark.git
   cd ipl-data-analysis-spark

   ## 📊 Visualizations

This project includes multiple IPL insights like:

- Top 10 run scorers
- Team-wise match victories
- Top six hitters

All charts are generated using PySpark and visualized using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The interactive version is deployed via Streamlit.

## 📖 Data Storytelling Highlights

- **Virat Kohli** dominates as the top scorer, showing consistency since IPL’s inception.
- **Mumbai Indians and CSK** top the match wins chart, validating their legacy.
- **Chris Gayle and AB de Villiers** lead in sixes, reflecting their explosive strike rate.
